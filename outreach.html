            <h2 class="subtitle">Vikings Robotics is devoted to 
                competition, but that is not our only mission. 
                Our members work year-round to build-up our 
                community through inspiring younger scholars. We 
                participate in outreach programs with local businesses, 
                teach students about real-world skills, and emphasize 
                STEM and STEM education. Vikings Robotics also actively 
                promotes diversity and inclusion, and our team is focused 
                on racial and gender based equality.

                <p class="st">The Vikings Robotics team presented their robot 
                    at the annual La Jolla Art and Wine Festival. As curious onlookers 
                    gathered, the Vikings passionately explained the 
                     mechanisms that powered their creation. The Vikings engaged 
                     with young adults, encouraging them to explore the exciting 
                     world of STEM, fostering a sense of wonder and possibility.</p>
