            <h2 class="subtitle">Vikings Robotics is devoted to 
                competition, but that is not our only mission. 
                Our members work year-round to build-up our 
                community through inspiring younger scholars. We 
                participate in outreach programs with local businesses, 
                teach students about real-world skills, and emphasize 
                STEM and STEM education. Vikings Robotics also actively 
                promotes diversity and inclusion, and our team is focused 
                on racial and gender based equality.

                    at the annual La Jolla Art and Wine Festival. As curious onlookers 
                    gathered, the Vikings passionately explained the 
                     mechanisms that powered their creation. The Vikings engaged 
                     with young adults, encouraging them to explore the exciting 
                     world of STEM, fostering a sense of wonder and possibility.</p>

                    at Riford library on May 19, 2024. The theme was “At the Beach”, 
                    where middle school students learned how to program with EV3 
                    (a type of block coding language for competition LEGO robotics) 
                    through a series of challenges related to the beach. 
                    These included things like programming the LEGO robot to push 
                    trash on the beach into the dumpster area, and pushing a lever to allow 
                    the LEGO surfer to surf the wave!
