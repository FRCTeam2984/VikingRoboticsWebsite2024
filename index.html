            <div></div>
            <p class="st">Vikings Robotics is the robotics team of La Jolla High School, located in San Diego, CA.  
                Every year we participate in the FIRST Robotics Competition, in which teams have 6 weeks to design and build a robot that competes in a sport-like event. At the end of the build season we attend regional competitions in San Diego with teams from around the world. At the 2018 San Diego Regional, we competed with teams from Chile, Denmark, Netherlands and Brazil.</p>

            <h1 class="h">OUR MISSION</h1>
            <p class="st">Vikings Robotics supports the building of real world skills, instilling an appreciation for STEM fields in our members. We are building a team that is ambitious, diligent, intelligent, disciplined, diverse and inclusive. We hope to inspire young people to participate in building a better community and a brighter future.</p>
        
            <h1 class="h">OUR HISTORY</h1>
            <p class="st">Vikings Robotics has participated in the FIRST Robotics Competition since 2009. It has made some notable achievements, including a quarterfinalist in the 2022 San Diego regional, semifinalist in 2019 and 2018, and winner of the 2011 Las Vegas regional.	</p>
